# Why we Prototype?

## "The Founder"
  * We play because it's fun and we're curious
  * Remove the tedious things and use your imagination to make it real
  * The goal is to make toys that engage your and other people’s imaginations.
  * You can spend countless hours creating an actual kitchen or even a mock kitchen, or you can use chalk and your imagination.
  
## Learning from Mistakes Faster

* I can’t speak for other people, but I prototype for one very important reason:

* I know I’m going to make mistakes the first time around and prototyping is one way I plan for my mistakes, because it allows me to make those mistakes faster and cheaper.

* The picture you see here is from the movie The Founder, which is about the story of the McDonald’s empire and how Ray Kroc wrested the company from the McDonald brothers.  In the movie, there’s a great vignette where Maurice McDonald is explaining to Ray how his brother Dick McDonald came up with what they called the “Speedee” system that delivered food in 30 seconds, not 30 minutes.  

## The Value of Cheap Prototypes

* Provides a medium to communicate ideas
* Focuses on the essence of the problem - Not the Details
* Cheap interactivity let’s us iterate and change course quickly

# Static Models

“Show me your flowchart and conceal your tables, and I shall continue to be mystified. Show me your tables, and I won't usually need your flowchart; it'll be obvious.” 

- Fred Brooks

“Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.” 

- Linus Torvalds

## Why Start with Static Models?

* Easiest way to capture ideas
* Engages our imagination
* Dynamic models can often be inferred
* Encourages people to ask clarifying questions

## What are we building Mr. Stakeholders?

* Show the essence of the restaurant as steps in an untyped say

## Let's Pretend We're Placing an Order - What would they look like?

* Are there rules as to what we can and can't order?

## What does the definition of an order look like?

* Show an order type and a sample order

## What about payment options?

* Show type aliases and option types.

## Show example payment
